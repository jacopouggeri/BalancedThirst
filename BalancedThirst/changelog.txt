- Fixed weird issue with container water expiration working only when placed down
- Removed some log spam
- Added handbook guide for thirst management
- Added Distilled water purity level, which has 0 vomit chance. Now distilled water has 0 vomit chance (pure is 2/10k).
- Distilled water can be turned into boiled water using salt (balanced as it needs a lot of distilled water with a 25L:1 ratio)
- Better ACA saucepan/cauldron water boiling
